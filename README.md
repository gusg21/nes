# gug's nes adventure!

Just a small learning project I'm working on to get familiar with both Assembly and the hardware of the NES. Using NESASM, NESST, YYCHR, FamiTone and Famitracker.

**Note**: All tools are included. Look in the tools/ folder.

### Project Structure

- root
  - test.bat
    - Compile the assembly code with the assembler, and run it with the emulator (MESEN).
  - res/
    - All music, graphics, palettes, and levels. Anything not code should go in here.
  - src/
    - All code should be in here.
